# CC:Tweaked-Draconic Manager

## Description

CC:Tweaked-Draconic Manager is a comprehensive control and monitoring program designed for ComputerCraft: Tweaked to manage Draconic Evolution reactors and energy cores. This system ensures the safe and efficient operation of your reactors and energy storage, leveraging wireless modem communication for a seamless and flexible setup.

## Features

- **Advanced Computer Touchscreen Interface**: Dynamically adjusting interface for easy interaction with your reactor and energy core.
- **Automated Regulation**: Maintains the input gate for a targeted field strength of 50%, adjustable as needed.
- **Failsafe Mechanisms**:
  - Immediate shutdown if field strength drops below 20% (adjustable).
  - Automatic activation upon successful charge.
  - Immediate shutdown if temperature exceeds 8000°C (adjustable).
  - Automatic activation when temperature cools down to 3000°C (adjustable).
- **Interactive Controls**: Easily tweak your output flux gate with touchscreen buttons in increments of +/-100k, 10k, and 1k.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Visual indicators, graphs, gauges, and colored status indicators for real-time reactor and energy core status.
- **Alert System**: Notifies players when the reactor is low on fuel.
- **Statistics Logging**: Records all aspects of the reactor and energy core performance for detailed analysis.
- **Plug-and-Play Setup**: Automatically detects peripherals and configures them for use.
- **Dynamic Monitor Adjustment**: Supports two sets of monitors that automatically adjust to the player's desired size.
